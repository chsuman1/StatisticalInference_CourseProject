The following are the objectives of this project: \n\n1. Load the ToothGrowth data and perform some basic exploratory data analyses \n2. Provide a basic summary of the data.\n3. Use confidence intervals and/or hypothesis tests to compare tooth growth by supp and dose. \n\n## 1. Exploratory Data Analysis\nWe first load the datasets package and examine the structure of the ToothGrowth dataset. \n\n```{r}\nlibrary (datasets)\ndata(ToothGrowth)\nstr (ToothGrowth)\n```\n\nNow we look at some basic statistics of this dataset. \n```{r}\nsummary (ToothGrowth)\n```\n\n## 2. Summary and Graphical Analysis\nNow we examine the data graphically. The plot below shows the `len` plotted against `dose` color conditioned on `supp`. We see that as the `dose` increases, the `len` increases as well. However, it is not clear whether the `supp` has any effect. \n\n```{r}\nlibrary (ggplot2)\npar (mfrow = c(1,1))\nggplot (aes(x = dose, y = len), data = ToothGrowth) + \n    geom_point(aes (color = supp)) + \n    labs (list(title = \"ToothGrowth by Dose and Supp\", x = \"Dose\", y = \"Supp\"))\n```\n\nNow, we look at a boxplot of `supp` against `len` to check whether we can see any discernable difference or pattern. However, the plot shows that there is a lot of overlap between the two delivery methods i.e. `supp`. So we still do not know whether `supp` has a significant effect on `len` or not. \n```{r}\npar (mfrow = c(1,1))\nggplot(aes(x=supp, y=len), data=ToothGrowth) + geom_boxplot(aes(fill=supp)) + \n    labs (list(title = \"ToothGrowth by Supp\", x = \"Supp\", y = \"Length\"))\n```\n\nNow, we look at a boxplot of `dose` against `len` to check whether we can see any pattern. The plot shows that as `dose` increases, the `len` increases as well. It is possible that `dose` has a significant effect on `len`. \n```{r}\npar (mfrow = c(1,1))\nggplot(aes(x=as.factor(dose), y=len), data=ToothGrowth) + geom_boxplot(aes(fill=dose)) + \n    labs (list(title = \"ToothGrowth by Dose\", x = \"Dose\", y = \"Length\"))\n```\n\n## 3. Confidence Intervals & Hypothesis Tests\nFirst, we use the t-test to check whether the `supp` is statistically significant. \n\n```{r}\ntTestSupp <- t.test(len ~ supp, data = ToothGrowth)\n``` \nThe p-value is `r tTestSupp$p.value`, which is relatively high. The 95% confidence interval contains zero. This indicates that we can not reject the null hypothesis that the two supplement types have no effect on tooth length `len`. \n\nWe will now test whether the dose has a significant effect on the tooth length. We know that the `dose` variable has three distinct values. We cannot use a t-test to test for the significance of all three values. So we have to divide them into separate sub-datasets. Then we use t-tests to check whether the `dose` has significant effect on the tooth length `len`. \n\n```{r}\n# Sub-groups based on dose pairs. \ndose051 <- subset (ToothGrowth, dose %in% c(0.5, 1.0)) \ndose052 <- subset (ToothGrowth, dose %in% c(0.5, 2.0)) \ndose12 <- subset (ToothGrowth, dose %in% c(1.0, 2.0)) \n\n# Check for differences in length due to change in dose levels: (0.5, 1.0)\nt.test(len ~ dose, data = dose051)\n\n# Check for differences in length due to change in dose levels: (0.5, 2.0)\nt.test(len ~ dose, data = dose052)\n\n# Check for differences in length due to change in dose levels: (1.0, 2.0)\nt.test(len ~ dose, data = dose12)\n```\n\nIn all three dose t-tests, the p-value is less than the fischer p-value of 0.05. Also, none of the 95% confidence interval contains zero. We see that the mean tooth length `len` increases with doseage `dose`. So we should reject the null hypothesis concluding that an increase in the dose level leads to an increase in tooth length.\n\n## 4. Conslusions\n1. Inreasing the doseage `dose` increases tooth growth `len`. \n2. The type of supplement used `supp`, whether its orange juice or vitamin C, has no discernable effect on tooth growth.\n\n#### Assumptions: \n\n1. Variances between the different populations of guinea pigs are not the same. \n2. The populations are independent. \n3. Experiment was conducted by randomizing the sample guinea pig selection. \n",
